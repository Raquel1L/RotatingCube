# RotatingCube
Hi, i made a really simple Augmented Reality app about Image Tracking. 
It consist's in detecting a particulary image and spawn a rotating cube over it without using directly the prefab of ARTRackedImageManager. I did it because, with this code, i manipulate a prefab ( or more than one ) in runtime ( rotating a cube in this example ) allowing to do a lot of cool stuff easily!
